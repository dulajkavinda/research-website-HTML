        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 20px;">
            Basically, Traditional interviewing process starts with the technical interview. In this phase, interviewee
            will have to
            provide answers for different question asked from them. These questions will be asked to evaluate the
            technical
            knowledge of the interviewee. The answers they provide will be taken as voice inputs to the system. After
            the voice
            inputs are taken in as texts. Before that words will be vectored using a Word2Vec model. After that, using a
            neural
            network, word similarities will be checked. Word similarity is checked to see the accuracy of the answers
            provided by
            the interviewee. The results will be stored in a No-SQL database, because there are many unstructured data
            to be saved
            for future uses. MongoDB Atlas delivers MongoDB for modern applications as a fully automated cloud
            service.The
            candidates might have their preferred working areas. Gathered voice input data will be used to detect
            specific keywords
            related to these different working areas. This keyword detection will be mostly based on examples that
            candidate using
            for explain some software engineering theories or applications. Those kind of keywords also will be
            extracted from this
            system and store inside the database for future usage. Overall this sub system focusing to conduct fair oral
            interviews
            for candidates with less human interactions.

        <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">2). Training Machine Learning model to evaluate
            answers of written test.</h4>
        <hr class="line" />
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 20px;">
            In order to calculate the document similarity, cosine similarity method has been used. Cosine similarity
            method requires the vector representation of a text document. Currently there are numerous methods turn a
            text document into its vector representation. But there's an issue. When a text document is turned into its
            vector representation using these methods, the context of the document is not considered. Thus, Doc2Vec has
            been used to avoid this issue. Doc2Vec is an expansion of the Word2Vec model. Unlike Word2Vec, Doc2Vec can
            be used to turn a whole document into its vector representation. Doc2Vec model requires tagged documents to
            be trained on. A customer method has been written to tag documents in train data set. After that a
            vocabulary has been created since Doc2Vec uses the vocabulary during the training process. After training
            the model, it is used to turn user given answers and pre-defined answers to vectors. Then, by using cosine
            similarity, similarity is checked and a score is given.

        <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">3). Categorizing candidates using processed data.</h4>
        <hr class="line" />
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 20px;">
            A classification algorithm has been used to do a text classification in order to predict a preferred working
            area. After predicting the area, candidate would be categorized under that predcited working area. Data
            related to 4 working areas have been collected and Support Vector Machine algorithm and Multinomial Naive
            Bayes algorithm were trained using the data. Based on the classification report of both algorithms,
            Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is selected. Prior to use the data to train the model, text documents have
            been converted into vectors using CountVectorizer. After that, using Tf - Idf has been used to downscale the
            words that occur in a document more than usually, such as "a, and, to". Since we are using Count Vectorizer,
            these words can affect the performance of the model. After that, the model is trained using the data.

        <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">4). Training Machine Learning model to predict future
            HRM related problems.</h4>

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
            This research part is to identify candidateâ€™s personality traits based on the information that gather from
            the CVs and question asked when candidates upload their CVs to this application. In this research big 5
            model used to predict personality traits.<br />
            The system built in this project predicts personality of peoples by using their gender, age, score of
            openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism and experience . It parses all the
            data from CV/resume and on the result page, it shows all the information from the entered data and uploaded
            resume. This system uses logistic regression for training the model and pyresparser module for parsing the
            information from resume which is built using nltk and spaCy module in python.
